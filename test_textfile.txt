Swansea City will be looking to take a massive step towards Premier League survival this evening when they face Antonio Conte’s Chelsea.


The Swans currently sit in 17thplace, four points clear of Southampton who occupy the final relegation spot.

The Saints face Bournemouth at home on Saturday, meaning a victory for them would really put the pressure on Carlos Carvahal’s men.

A positive result for Swansea won’t be handed to them either, as they face a Chelsea team full of talent and still within a chance to finish in the top 4.

With both teams fighting for their respective spots, the clash in South Wales may prove to be a nervy one.

This could actually favour Swansea more, and they will certainly take confidence in the fact that Chelsea have failed to beat them at the Liberty Stadium in their previous two matches (D1 L1).

Carvahal has introduced a new lease of energy within the club since his arrival, lifting his side out of the relegation places and giving hope to the Swansea faithful.

Home victories against Liverpool, Arsenal and high-flying Burnley will give the fans hope of another impressive three points, especially against a side that hasn’t hit the same heights as last season.

There has also been a lot of speculation regarding whether Conte will remain as Chelsea manager next season, so Swansea will be looking to strike as they hope to maintain their Premier League status for a seventh successive season.

Just like Conte, speculation has recently arisen regarding the future of Swansea’s midfielder Ki, who has been linked to Everton this summer.

The South Korean was present in the starting line-up during last week’s battering by Manchester City – but it is unsure if he will start against Chelsea.

Elsewhere on the pitch, Carvahal will be without Fernandez and Bartley, two players who are key in Swansea’s recent system of playing three central defenders.
